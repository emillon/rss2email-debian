        Getting Started With rss2email
        ==============================
        
        We highly recommend that you subscribe to the rss2email project feed
        so you can keep up to date with the latest version, bugfixes and
        features:

        Installing rss2email
        ====================
        
        Packages
        --------
        
        A quick way to get rss2email going is using pre-made packages. Here
        are releases for Debian__ Linux, Ubuntu__ Linux, Gentoo__ Linux,
        openSUSE__, and NetBSD__.
        
        __ `Debian package`_
        __ `Ubuntu package`_
        __ `Gentoo package`_
        __ `openSUSE package`_
        __ `NetBSD package`_
        
        Installing by hand
        ------------------
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Before you install rss2email, you'll need to make sure that a few
        things are in place.
        
        1. Ensure that a version of Python_ â‰¥3.2 is installed.
        2. Install the required Python packages.
        
          1. feedparser_
          2. html2text_
        
        3. Figure out how you are going to send outgoing email.  You have two
           options here: either use an STMP server or a local sendmail
           program.  So,
        
          * determine your outgoing email server's SMTP address, or
          * install sendmail (or a compatible replacement like postfix).
        
        Download
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Download the latest rss2email source and unpack it.  You can choose
        from several equivalent formats.
        
        1. A ``.zip`` file (suggested for Microsoft Windows users)::
        
            $ wget https://github.com/wking/rss2email/archive/v3.3.zip
            $ unzip rss2email-*.zip
        
        2. A ``.tar.gz`` file (suggested for everyone else)::
        
            $ wget https://github.com/wking/rss2email/archive/v3.3.tar.gz
            $ tar xvf rss2email*.tar.gz
        
        3. A Git_ checkout (suggested for developers)::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/wking/rss2email.git
        
        Install
        ~~~~~~~
        
        From the unpacked directory, run::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        You can pass all the usual options to the ``install`` command,
        including ``--user``.  If you don't want to install rss2email, you can
        also run ``r2e`` directly from the source directory.
        
        Upgrading to a new version
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just repeat the installation procedure for the new source package.  If
        your config file and data file were in the old source directory, move
        them over to the new source directory.  If the config and data files
        were in another directory (e.g. ``~/.config`` and ``~/.local/share``),
        there is no need to move them.
        
        Using rss2email
        ===============
        
        Create a new feed database to send updates to your email address::
        
          $ r2e new you@yourdomain.com
        
        This command will create a configuration file
        (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rss2email.cfs`` by default) and a feed database
        (``$XDG_DATA_HOME/rss2email.json`` by default).  If you'd rather those
        files were stored in other locations, use the ``--config`` and
        ``--data`` options.  ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` defaults to ``$HOME/.config``
        and ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` defaults to ``$HOME/.local/share``.
        
        You should edit the default configuration file now to adjust rss2email
        for your local system.  Unless you've installed a local
        sendmail-equivalent, you'll need to edit the SMTP_ options.
        
        Subscribe to some feeds::
        
          $ r2e add rss2email http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.mail.rss2email
        
        That's the feed to be notified when there's a new version of
        rss2email. Repeat this for each feed you want to subscribe to.
        
        When you run rss2email, it emails you about every story it hasn't seen
        before. But the first time you run it, that will be every story. To
        avoid this, you can ask rss2email not to send you any stories the
        first time you run it::
        
          r2e run --no-send
        
        Then later, you can ask it to email you new stories::
        
          r2e run
        
        Customizing rss2email
        =====================
        
        There are a number of options, described in full in
        ``rss2email/config.py``, to customize the way rss2email behaves. If
        you want to change something, edit the the configuration file that was
        created by ``r2e new``.
        
        For example, if you want to receive HTML mail, instead of having
        entries converted to plain text::
        
          html-mail = True
        
        To be notified every time a post changes, instead of just when it's
        first posted::
        
          trust-guid = True
        
        And to make the emails look as if they were sent when the item was
        posted::
        
          date-header = True
        
        If you get an error message ``Sender domain must exist``, add the
        following to your configuration file::
        
          from = rss2email@yoursite.com
          force-from = True
        
        You can make the email address whatever you want, but your mail server
        requires that the ``yoursite.com`` part actually exists.
        
        SMTP
        ----
        
        By default, rss2email uses sendmail (or an equivalent) to send
        outgoing email.  If you don't have such a program installed, or simply
        prefer to use SMTP__ directly, edit the configuration file and fill in
        your outoing email server's details::
        
          [DEFAULT]
          ...
          use-smtp = True
          smtp-server = smtp.yourisp.net:587
          smtp-auth = False
          ...
        
        If your server requires you to login, change ``smtp-auth = False`` to
        ``smtp-auth = True`` and enter your email username and password::
        
          smtp-auth = True
          smtp-username = username
          smtp-password = password
        
        If your server requires an `TLS/SSL`_ connection (SMTPS), change
        ``smtp-ssl = False`` to ``smtp-ssl = True``.  If your server does
        not require a SMTPS connection but you request authentication,
        rss2email will use STARTTLS_ to encrypt the connection before sending
        your login credentials to the server.

        Automating rss2email
        ====================
        
        More than likely you will want rss2email to run automatically at a
        regular interval. Under Windows this is can be easily accomplished
        using the Windows Task Scheduler. This site has a
        nice tutorial__ on it. Just select ``r2e.bat`` as the program to run. Once
        you've created the task, double click on it in the task list and
        change the Run entry so that ``run`` comes
        after ``r2e.bat``. For example, if you installed rss2email in
        the ``C:\rss2email`` directory, then you would change the Run
        entry from ``C:\rss2email\r2e.bat``
        to ``C:\rss2email\r2e.bat run``.
        
        __ `windows scheduler`_
        
        On Unix/Linux systems, you should add a cron_ job that runs ``r2e``.
        For example, run ``r2e`` every night (at 1:23 am) with::
        
          23 1 * * * r2e run
