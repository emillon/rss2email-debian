![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/lisandropm.png) I have just uploaded
[Qt](http://qt-project.org/) 4.8.4 to experimental. Apart from being the
newest upstream release of the 4 series, it adds the basic support for
coexisting with Qt 5. Because of this support it will need to go trough the
[NEW queue](http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html) though, so we will need to
be patient.

  
Developers will be interested in
[qtchooser](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtchooser), the tool that allows to
switch between Qt 4 and 5 development apps. It has also been uploaded to
experimental.

  
Of course, all this has been possible thanks to the efforts of the wonderful
[Qt/KDE](http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/) team =)

  
**Update:** our efficacious FTP masters have already made Qt pass the NEW queue. Thanks a lot!

Review: An Election, by John Scalzi

Publisher:

Subterranean

Copyright:

2010

Printing:

2012

ISBN:

1-59606-496-X

Format:

Kindle

Pages:

24

This is another story from the Subterranean Scalzi Super Bundle that probably
doesn't justify a full review, particularly since this time it's a short story
and not even a novelette, but as with the others it's been independently
published on the Kindle (and is still available that way for 99 cents). So by
my obsessive internal consistency that matters only to me, it gets a full
review anyway.

I was mildly surprised to find that this was actually my second reading, and
now vaguely remember that Subterranean had actually sponsored the story's
appearance on Scalzi's blog as an [advertising
experiment](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/11/01/a-short-fiction-
experiment/). So I originally read the story from Scalzi's blog, and if you
don't really want to pay money for it, [you still can as
well](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/11/01/an-election-a-short-story-
presented-by-subterranean-press/). Along with a couple of ads that appear to
have bit-rotted.

The chief feature of An Election is the background: a world in which aliens
and humans are intermingled in a political district, going about their lives
against a background of rather extreme multispecies diversity. The
protagonist, David, decides to run for the upcoming city council special
election, despite living in a district that's minority-human and that hasn't
seen a human councilor in forty-four years. (David also happens to be a gay
man, which goes entirely unremarked in the story and is, in fact, entirely
unremarkable given the excitingly diverse characteristics of his alien
neighbors. I thought that was a nice touch.) He of course appears to stand no
chance, particularly when one of the city bosses decides to run as well, but
ends up with a campaign advisor almost by accident and determinedly attempts
to connect with his neighbors and earn their votes.

This felt quite typical to me of Scalzi's humor writing. The protagonist is a
good-hearted person who gets in rather over his head but is still determined
to do the right thing, while not taking anything too seriously. The background
humor is never particularly threatening and tends towards slapstick and
banter. I found it similar in tone to most of [Agent to the
Stars](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-7653-5700-3.html), although
of course much shorter. As usual, Scalzi's grasp of conversational banter is
probably the strongest part of the story; the dynamic between David, his
husband James, and his campaign advisor brought several chuckles for me.

This is slight but enjoyable. I wouldn't go out of my way to read it, but it's
a good story to toss into a bundle of other work, and I remember it holding my
interest when reading it on-line. (Which is rare; usually I fail to finish any
fiction I try to read in a browser unless it's extremely short.)

Rating: 6 out of 10

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/noodles.png)

I've moved (only a couple of blocks from where I was before), and as the new
place has [Webpass](http://www.webpass.net/) I've reluctantly given up my
[Sonic.net](http://www.sonic.net) connection, along with its static IPv4
address and ISP IPv6 tunnel. Hard to resist a 200Mb/s ethernet connection for
the same price I was paying for 18Mb/s ADSL2 though.

However that leaves my DGN3500 router somewhat inappropriate for providing my
net connection. Freed from the need for an ADSL/cable router I decided it was
time to build an all in one house server (I'm a believer in as few always on
boxes as possible). I already had a nettop acting as a media box, but wanted
to build something that would handle:

  * Gateway for the external network connection 
    * Routing to internal ethernet
    * 2.4GHz wifi router
    * 5GHz wifi router
  * Printer server
  * House NAS 
    * Backup server (syncing externally as well)
    * DLNA server
  * mpd server
  * ATSC based PVR

Probably in that order if it turns out I'm asking too much. The intention is
the box is the only one that always needs to be on, so I wanted it to be low
power consumption. I also wanted the option of hooking it up to the TV if it
turned out to have enough grunt, so the case needed to be something suitable
for the living room.

I like Intel's approach to graphics drivers, in particular the existence of
Free video acceleration support, so I went with an [Intel Core
i3-3220T](http://ark.intel.com/products/65694/Intel-Core-i3-3220T-Processor-
3M-Cache-2_80-GHz) as the processor. It's a 35W Ivybridge processor with HD
2500 graphics, plus I got it for a decent price.

For the case I chose a [CFI A2059](http://www.e-itx.com/cfi-a2059.html).
There's a local supplier I was able to pick it up from, it has a couple of
large fans which helps keeps the noise down while keeping things cool and as I
was aiming for backup / file sharing being more important than a media box the
2 hot swap bays tipped the balance away from an AV style case.

The small case limits the motherboard options. I wanted twin GigE ports so the
external was entirely separate from the internal (my switch does VLANs so I
could have made do with a single port, but with a 200Mb/s connection I didn't
really want to share the port). The [Gigabyte GA-H77N-
WIFI](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4338) seemed to
fit the bill, with the added advantage of a built in WiFi card (an Intel 2230
in a mini PCI-E slot) which leaves the PCI-E slot free for either a TV tuner
or a second WiFi card to cover 5GHz.

I maxed out the board with 2 [8G G.SKILL
DDR3-1600](http://www.gskill.com/products.php?index=482) DIMMs. I normally go
Crucial because I've found them reliable, but these were slightly cheaper and
available from the same place as the motherboard.

Finally I added a [Seagate ST4000DM000](http://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-
drives/desktop-hard-drives/desktop-hdd/?sku=ST4000DM000) for storage. It
actually came from a Backup Plus that [Costco](http://www.costco.com/) were
selling for about $20 less than the bare drive sells for. The plan is to add
at least another 1T drive to RAID1 the most important bits (or possibly a 2T -
it depends which of my existing drives I can tidy stuff off most easily).

Of course it's running [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and I took the
opportunity to try out the RC1 Wheezy image. For extra giggles I did an EFI
install; this all worked fine except I didn't end up with grub-efi installed
at the end, instead I had grub-pc. I booted with legacy BIOS enabled and
followed Tanguy's [switch to UEFI boot](http://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article51
/debian-efi) instructions.

Further notes on software setup to follow...

After having used mutt for about a decade, I decided it's time I move away
from it, for various reasons that I won't go into here.

I've been evaluating thunderbird^Wicedove now for a few weeks, but I can
already see I won't keep using it forever, because I find too many issues with
it:

  1. I can't tell the thing that I never ever ever want to write HTML-formatted emails. While there is an option "Compose messages in HTML format" in the "Account settings" dialog, that only seems to impact the behaviour of the client upon "new mail", not its reply behaviour, forcing me to go to Options->Format and switch it off.
  2. To make matters worse, the HTML editor and the plain-text editor are _not the same dialog_. That means it is not possible to switch on HTML formatting if it wasn't on originally (not a problem for me, but I can imagine it being a problem for others), but also that the fugly quoting style (vertical line next to the text) of the HTML editor is not removed when you switch from HTML to plain-text. Further on, it has issues when you want to remove white space, where it will remove entire quoting levels rather than just an empty line. This is horrible, horrible behaviour.
  3. While there is support for multiple email addresses connected to the same IMAP account, it does appear that there is no support for automatically choosing the right email address based on user-defined rules, such as "which mail folder are we currently in". Having to remember that I need to select the right mail address is tiresome and error-prone; e.g., when I'm in a Debian-related mail folder, I want my mail client to use my Debian mail address _automatically_. It appears the only way in which icedove can automatically select sender addresses is by checking the recipient list in the To: and Cc: headers for any of its configured mail addresses, and using that to decide what to put in the from: header.

Any one of the above would eventually be enough for me to grow tired of
icedove and switch to something else; but the three combined mean that I'll be
looking for something else fairly soon.

Suggestions are, of course, welcome.

You can use bzip2 to compress debian.tar source file in debian/source/options.
But usually xz is more efficient than bzip2 (in my experience, and I love xz
:) So, how about re-compressing those files with xz?

  
This is the result.

  

> 2.1G tar

503M current

414M xz_6e

410M xz_9e

  
non-compressed file is 2.1GB and we've compressed to 0.5GB. If we would use
xz, it becomes 0.4GB.

  
debian.tar.bz2 files are 6.3M, if we would use gz, it becomes 40M, it means
that package maintainers' choice is right.

  

> 6.3M bz2

40M gz

5.8M xz

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/jmtd.png)

With GNOME 3, if you want to override a setting with a new site default,
assuming your app has been updated to use the new `gsettings` API and doesn't
still use the old `gconf` one, the best guide on what to do is still [Ross
Burton's blog post from two years ago](http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers
/gsettings-override-2011-07-04-15-45), although you can find most of what you
need to know buried deep in the [GSettings C API specification](https://develo
per.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettings.html#GSettings.description), which is not
the first place I would have looked (lesson learned!)

Note: In this context I'm in the role of systems administrator, rather than
distributor/vendor or software author. Whereas you are generally advised to
use `gsettings` itself and not poke at the backend (`dconf` for Linux), the
documentation seems to [point sysadmins towards dconf hackery rather than
gsettings](https://live.gnome.org/dconf/SystemAdministrators). However
`gsettings` worked for me, and I got nowhere with `dconf` direct.

Some caveats worth knowing about:

  * Throughout the GNOME documentation and tools, "schema", "key" and "path" are used nearly interchangeably to mean roughly the same thing. (I think a path describes a key within a schema, to be precise.)
  * schemas/keys/paths ["must start with and end with a forward slash character"](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettings.html#GSettings.description), except when they mustn't, such as in override files, where you must use a dot, and you don't prefix or suffix the schema/key/path with dots. In fact the command line `gsettings` tool only accepts dotted schemas, not slash-separated ones.
  * Sometimes, people choose XML, and save themselves the trouble of writing a custom parser, but at the expense of ease for humans having to read or write files. `gsettings` uses XML for schema files, but a separate ini-style format for override files. Everybody wins?
  * `glib-compile-schemas` requires a path argument, so all your schema and override files must be in the same place. Sites have to lump stuff into `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas` alongside distribution files, rather than separated out to (say) `/usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas`.
  * It's quite possible to get an override file past `glib-compile-schemas` which non-the-less is broken. The result is gsettings clients, including the `gsettings` binary itself, complaining and then segfaulting. Do not rely on `glib-compile-schemas` to ensure compliant override files.
  * `glib-compile-schemas` would appear to read override files in native byte order, so make sure you name your override so that it sorts after any distribution-provided overrides. E.g., `20_my_gnome-shell.gschema.override` to sort after `10_gnome-shell.gschema.override`.

Today I had to create 40 guest accounts on our 70-seat Linux cluster,
including randomly generate passwords, set up persistent storage on our NFS
server, etc.; quickly. As a nice-to-have I also wanted to add some application
icons to the GNOME 3 "Favourite Apps" menu for the guests. Would you like to
guess which of those jobs was the easier of the two?

I was going to post this yesterday, but some might have thought that it was a
joke. April 1st is always an annoying day to communicate real information.

If you have been fond of the way Debian and Ubuntu manage multiple PostgreSQL
versions in parallel, you can now have the same on OS X with Homebrew:

    
    brew tap petere/postgresql  
    brew install postgresql-9.2  
    # etc.  
    brew install --HEAD postgresql-common  
    

`postgresql-common` is the same code as in Debian, only mangled a little.

Now you have all the client programs symlinked through `pg_wrapper`, and you
can use the server management tools such as:

    
    pg_createcluster 9.2 main  
    pg_ctlcluster 9.2 main start  
    pg_lsclusters  
    

Let me know if you find this useful.

  * [`postgresql-common` `homebrew` branch](https://github.com/petere/postgresql-common/tree/homebrew)

I'm involved with a number of free software projects as both a developer and
as the maintainer of packages for various distributions such as
[Debian](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=daniel@pocock.com.au) (which
also feeds packages to Ubuntu) and
[OpenCSW](http://www.opencsw.org/maintainers/daniel/).

I regularly come across the following situations:

  * Developers of great software who would like to see it packaged, distributed and promoted conveniently through platforms like Debian
  * Users of Linux distributions who are keen to use free software if it is presented in a convenient and accessible manner they are familiar with.

Sadly, despite everybody having the best intentions, there is sometimes a
chasm separating these two groups of people.

Upstream developers are often busy developing new features and don't have time
to work on the intricacies of packaging. I hope that by sharing a few of my
own experiences I can help more developers get their software packaged more
easily.

Fortunately, a number of great tools like _git-buildpackage_ have emerged for
streamlining the packaging process, but this has also created more confusion
for developers who have their own git repositories and don't quite understand
how the Debian git repository and patching process relates to their own
repository.

### The autotools world

Here, I focus on [autotools](http://www.gnu.org/savannah-
checkouts/gnu/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html#Autotools-
Introduction) based software, because this type of software has it's own
peculiar issues when packaging. In particular, these issues appear when using
a version control system to track upstream releases. Some of the concepts can
be applied to the study of regular Makefile or cmake projects as well.

Here is a diagram giving an overview:

![](http://danielpocock.com/sites/danielpocock.com/files/release-packaging-
workflow.png)

Let's work through each of the steps in the diagram:

### The upstream release

  1. The developer/release manager updates the version number in  

    
    configure.ac

(sometimes called configure.in) and tags the code. (Usually this tag is on a
dedicated release branch.)

  2. The developer checks out a copy of the code from the tag into a fresh working directory
  3. The developer runs the _autoreconf_/_automake_ tools, usually from a _bootstrap_ script. These tools create a number of new files that don't exist in the project repository. Finally, the developer runs  

    
    make dist

, which puts all the files,

including the generated files, into a distribution tarball. It is worth
emphasizing this point: the tarball is not just an archive of the files from
the repository/tag, it also contains a number of

files generated by _autotools_.

  4. The developer uploads the tarball to a web site such as the Sourceforge download page. Usually a release announcement is made now containing checksums for the tarball.

At this point, the upstream developer's work is done and packaging teams from
various projects such as Debian will take over. Sometimes, the upstream
developer is also building the packages and continues

onto the next steps himself:

### Packaging

  5. The package is downloaded by the package maintainer
  6. If it is the first download, the maintainer creates a new git repository. If it has been packaged before, he clones the repository. _The important point here is that this is not the upstream repository, it is an independent repository for Debian packaging._ The maintainer uses the _git-import-orig_ tool to import the upstream tarball into the packaging repository. The _git-import-orig_ tool captures an exact snapshot of the upstream release tarball contents in a branch called _upstream_. One point where the Debian repository differs fundamentally from the upstream repository is that all files from the tarball will be tracked in the Debian git repository, even those automatically generated files that were created by _autotools_ and don't exist in the upstream repository.
  7. The maintainer creates or updates the various artifacts for packaging. These files are kept on the _master_ branch, and the tarball contents from the _upstream_ branch are merged into _master_ to create packages.
  8. When the maintainer feels the code is ready, he will check out a clean copy of the repository to build the package from.
  9. The maintainer executes a tool such as _git-buildpackage_ or regular _dpkg-buildpackage_, which creates the *.deb files.
  10. The files are checked with a tool like _lintian_ and some manual testing/installation. If all is OK, a tag is made in the packaging repository, with a suffix appended to the upstream version number to indicate which iteration of the package it applies to.

Last year, I failed to write and mention that I'd joined the Council of the
Free/Libre Open-Source Software UK group [FLOSS UK](http://flossuk.org/),
formerly known as the UK UNIX User's Group (UKUUG). As a council-member, I
helped to organise the recent [Large Installation Systems Administration
conference that took place in my native Newcastle,
UK](http://www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2013).

Five years ago I gave a talk at the (then) UKUUG Linux conference in
Manchester, 2008, about documentation for sysadmins, using ikiwiki. I recently
noticed that I hadn't put the abstract or slides up here, [so now I
have](http://jmtd.net/log/../software/ikiwiki/).

Daniel Pocock posted [The multiple repository conundrum in Linux
packaging](http://danielpocock.com/autotools-project-distribution-and-
packaging-on-debian). While a generally good and useful post, which upstream
developers will find helpful to understand how Debian packages their software,
it contains this statement:

> If it is the first download, the maintainer creates a new git repository. If
it has been packaged before, he clones the repository. The important point
here is that this is not the upstream repository, it is an independent
repository for Debian packaging.

The only thing important about that point is that it highlights an unnecessary
disconnect between the Debian developer and upstream development. One which
upstream will surely find annoying and should certainly not be bothered with.

There is absolutely no technical reason to not use the upstream git repository
as the basis for the git repository used in Debian packaging. I would never
package software maintained in a git repository upstream and not do so.

The details are as follows:

  * For historical reasons that are continuingly vanishing in importance, Debian fetishises the tarballs produced by upstream. While upstreams increasingly consider them an unimportant distraction, Debian insists in hoarding and rolling around in on its nest of gleaming pristine tarballs.

I wrote [pristine-tar](http://joeyh.name/blog/../code/pristine-tar/) to
facilitate this behavior, while also pointing fun at it, and perhaps
introducing a weak spot with which to eventually slay this particular dragon.
It is widely used within Debian.

.. Anyway, the point is that it's no problem to import upstream's tarball into
a clone if their git repository. It's fine if that tarball includes files not
present in their git repository. Indeed, upstream can do this at release time
if they like. Or Debian developers can do it and push a small quantity of data
back to upstream in a branch.

  * Sometimes tagged releases in upstream git repositories differ from the files in their released tarballs. This is actually, in my experience, less due to autotools generated files, and more due to manual and imperfect release processes, human error, etc. (Arguably, autotools are a form of human error.)

When this happens, and the Debian developer is tracking upstream git, they can
quite easily modify their branch to reflect the contents of the tarball as
closely as they desire. Or modify the source package uploaded to Debian to
include anything left out of the tarball.

My favorite example of this is an upstream who forgot to include their README
in their released tarball. Not a made up example; as mentioned tarballs are
increasingly an irrelevant side-show to upstreams. If I had been treating the
tarball as canonical I would have released a package with no documentation.

  * Whenever Debian developers interact with upstream, whether it's by filing bug reports or sending patches, they're going to be referring to refs in the upstream git repository. They need to have that repository available. The closer and better the relationship with upstream, the more the DD will use that repository. Anything that pulls them away from using that repository is going to add friction to dealing with upstream.

There have, historically, been quite a lot of sources of friction. From
upstreams who choose one VCS while the DD preferred using another, to DDs low
on disk space who decided to only version control the `debian` directory, and
not the upstream source code. With disk space increasingly absurdly cheap, and
the preponderance of development converging on git, there's no reason for this
friction to be allowed to continue.

So using the upstream git repository is valuable. And there is absolutely no
technical value, and plenty of potential friction in maintaining a history-
disconnected git repository for Debian packaging.

Lately, I have been working on providing nightly packages of the whole LLVM
toolchain.

With the help of folks from Intel, Google and Apple, I am happy to announce
the publication of these packages:

[http://llvm.org/apt/](http://llvm.org/apt/)

Built through a Jenkins instance ([http://llvm-jenkins.debian.net/](http
://llvm-jenkins.debian.net/)), packages for Debian wheezy and Unstable and
Ubuntu quantal, precise and raring are created twice a day.

3.2 and 3.3 llvm-toolchain packages are currently waiting in the [Debian NEW
queue](http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html).

More information on the [LLVM blog](http://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/llvm-

Today the [Isenkram package](http://packages.qa.debian.org/isenkram) finally
made it into the archive, after lingering in NEW for many months. I uploaded
it to the Debian experimental suite 2013-01-27, and today it was accepted into
the archive.

Isenkram is a system for suggesting to users what packages to install to work
with a pluggable hardware device. The suggestion pop up when the device is
plugged in. For example if a Lego Mindstorm NXT is inserted, it will suggest
to install the program needed to program the NXT controller. Give it a go, and
report bugs and suggestions to BTS. :)

I've meant to look at [Hy](http://github.com/paultag/hy) since [Paul
Tagliamonte](http://http://blog.pault.ag/) started to talk to me about it, =
but
never took a chance until now. Yesterday, Paul indicated it was a good time
for me to start looking at it, so I spent a few hours playing.

# But what's Hy?

Python is very nice: it has a great community and a wide range of useful
libraries. But let's face it, it misses a great language.

Hy is an implementation of a
[Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) on top of
Python.

Technically, Hy is built directly with a custom made parser (for now) which
then translates expressions using the [Python
AST](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html) module to generate code, wh=
ich
is then run by Python. Therefore, it shares the same properties as Python, =
and
is a Lisp-1 (i.e. with a single namespace for symbols and functions).

If you're interested to listen Paul talking about Hy during last PyCon US, I
recommend watching his lightning talk. As the name implies, it's only a few
minutes long.

# Does it work?

I've been cloning the code and played around a bit with Hy. And to my great=
est
surprise and pleasure, it works quite well. You can imagine writing Python
from there easily. Part of the syntax smells like
[Clojure](http://clojure.org)'s, which looks like a good thing since they're
playing in the same area.

You can try a [Hy REPL](http://hy.pault.ag/) in your Web browser if you wan=
t.

Here's what some code look like:

   =20
    (import requests) =20
    =A0 =20
    (setv req (requests.get "http://hy.pault.ag")) =20
    (if (=3D req.status_code 200) =20
      (for (kv (.iteritems req.headers)) =20
        (print kv)) =20
      (throw (Exception "Wrong status code"))) =20
   =20

 =20
This code would ouput:

   =20
    ('date', 'Wed, 03 Apr 2013 12:09:23 GMT')
    ('connection', 'keep-alive')
    ('content-encoding', 'gzip')
    ('transfer-encoding', 'chunked')
    ('content-type', 'text/html; charset=3Dutf-8')
    ('server', 'nginx/1.2.6')
   =20

As you can see, it's really simple to write Lispy code that really uses Pyt=
hon
idioms.

There's obviously still a lots of missing features in Hy. The language if f=
ar
from complete and many parts are moving, but it's really promising, and Pau=
l's
doing a great job implementing every idea.

![](http://julien.danjou.info/media/images/hy-photo.jpg)

I actually started to hack a bit on Hy, and will try to continue to do so,
since I'm really eager to learn a bit more about both Lisp and Python
internals in the process. I've already send a few patches on small bugs I've
encountered, and proposed a few ideas. It's really exciting to be able to
influence early a language design that I'll love to use! Being a recent fan=
 of
Common Lisp, I tend to grab the good stuff from it to add them into Hy.

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/lfaraone-mini.png) A few weeks ago I taught
a class on _Open Source: Contributing to free culture_ ([catalog
entry](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/Spark/2013/catalogpreview/7183)) for
[Spark](http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Spark/index.html), a one-day program put on
by the student-run MIT [Educational Studies Program](http://esp.mit.edu/). I
was fortunate to have two helpful co-teachers, [Tyler
Hallada](http://hallada.net/) and [Jacob
Hurwitz](http://mit.edu/jhurwitz/www/), who assisted with the lesson plan and
the in class lecture.

  
We ended up teaching 3 sessions of the 1hr 50min class that Saturday, with
about 10 students in each session.

  
I was pretty impressed by the quality of the students; a number of them had
used [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) before, but even
those who hadn't were able to gain something from the experience. The class
was broken up into three segments:

  

  1. Lecture on a brief history of open source and the free software movement
  2. Small research project on an open source project
  3. Lab where students could work through [OpenHatch's training missions](https://openhatch.org/missions/)

The point was to mix up what could otherwise be a very boring lecture.

  
I think we might have missed the mark on the last bit, as I get the feeling
that we didn't end up giving the students good actionables. While the quality
of OpenHatch is high and the organization's [campus
outreach](http://campus.openhatch.org/) programs are amazing, skills practice
only goes so far without clear direction to apply said skills. I'll be
following up with the class participants to see how they're progressing on
their own open source contributor journey, and will post updates if I have
any.

  
While not an OpenHatch event, if this sort of thing interests you, OpenHatch
runs [a series of events](http://openhatch.org/events/) like this one and has
a [mailing list](http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events) for
discussing planning and sharing best practices. Subscribe and say hi!

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/gildor.png)

Puppet is a nice tool but it has a significant problem with passwords:

  * it is recommended to store puppet manifests (*.pp) and related files in a VCS (i.e. git)
  * it is not recommended to store password in a VCS

This lead to complex situation and various workaround that more or less work:

  * serve password in a separate file/DB or do an _extlookup_ on the master (pre-set passwords)
  * store password on the server and get them through a _generate_ function (random password but on the master)

Most of these workarounds are complex, don't allow you to share the password
you have set easily and most of the time are stored in another place than the
target node.

So I have decided to create my own solution:
**[sekred](http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/sekred/)** (LGPL-2.1).

The idea of sekred is to generate the password on the target node and made it
available to the user that needs it. Then the user just have to _ssh_ into the
host and get the password.

Pro:

  * the password is generated and stored on the node
  * no VCS commit of your password
  * no DB storage of your password beside the local filesystem of the host
  * no need to use a common pre-set password for all you host, the password is randomly generated for only one host
  * to steal the password you need to crack the host first but if you have root access on the host, accessing a random generated password is pointless

Cons:

  * the password is stored in clear text
  * the password is only protected by the filesystem ACL

Let see some concrete examples.

## Setting mysql root password

This is a very simple problem. When you first install mysql on Debian Squeeze,
the root password is not set. That's bad. Let set it using sekred and puppet.

    
    node "mysqlserver" {
    
      package {
        ["mysql-server",
         "mysql-client",
         "sekred"]:
          ensure => installed;
      }
    
      service {
        "mysqld":
          name => "mysql",
          ensure => running,
          hasrestart => true,
          hasstatus => true;
      }
    
      exec {
        "mysql-set-root-password":
          command => "mysqladmin -u root password $(sekred get root@mysql)",
          onlyif => "mysql -u root",  # Trigger only if password-less root account.
          require => [Service["mysqld"], Package["mysql-client", "sekred"]];
      }
    }
    

And to get the root password for mysql, just login into the node
"mysqlserver":

    
    $> sekred get root@mysql
    Cie8ieza
    

## Setting password for SSH-only user

This example is quite typical of the broken fully automated scenario with
passwords: - you setup a remote host only accessible through SSH - you create
a user and set its SSH public key to authorize access - your user **cannot**
access its account because SSH prevent password-less account login!

In other word, you need to login into the node, set a password for the user
and mail him back.... That defeats a little bit the "automation" provided by
puppet.

Here is what I do with sekred:

    
    define user::template () {
      user {
        $name:
          ensure => present,
          membership => minimum,
          shell => "/bin/bash",
          ....
      }
      include "ssh_keys::$name"
    
      # Check password less account and set one, if required.
      $user_passwd="$(sekred get --uid $name $name@login)"
      exec {
        "user-set-default-password-$name":
          command => "echo $name:$user_passwd | chpasswd",
          onlyif => "test \"$(getent shadow $name | cut -f2 -d:)\" = \"!\"",
          require => [User[$name], Package["sekred"]];
      }
    }
    

So the command _"test \"$(getent shadow $name | cut -f2 -d:)\" = \"!\""_ test
for a password-less account. If this is the case, it creates a password using
_sekred get --uid $name $name@login_ and set it through _chpasswd_.

Note that _$user_passwd_ use a shell expansion that will be evaluated when
running the command only, on the host. The _--uid_ flag of sekred assign the
ownership of the password to the given user id.

So now the user (foo) can login into the node and retrieve its password using
_sekred get foo@login_.

## Try it!

Sekred was a very short project but I am pretty happy with it. It solves a
long standing problem and helps to cover an extra mile of automation when
setting up new nodes.

Today was spent at my apartment with Zoe. Harvey Norman were scheduled to
deliver the fridge, washing machine and TV. Someone from Telstra was scheduled
to come out and monkey with the MDF to get the naked ADSL happening, and my
desk was scheduled to be delivered.

My parents drove us over in the morning, with some of our suitcases. Zoe was
very happy with her new room and bed.

I was going to get a 1 hour advance warning of Harvey Norman coming, so we all
went for a little walk around the neighbourhood to explore. It turns out
there's a convenience store right next door, which is, well extremely
convenient. I won't need to even hop in the car to get last minute bread or
milk or anything like that. Very happy about that. There's also a really
gorgeous little [boutique deli/gourmet
grocery](http://www.hawthornegarage.com.au/) that is easily within walking
distance. The neighbourhood is indeed very nice.

Mid-morning, Brent dropped around with his daughter to say hi. Zoe had a good
time playing with her as well, and we went out for lunch at the Hawthorne
Garage. At the end of lunch, Harvey Norman called to say they'd be an hour
away, which was well timed.

Zoe declined to nap again, so we just hung out waiting for the delivery. In
the middle of them delivering, the desk delivery happened as well, and then as
Brent was leaving, the Telstra guy turned up, so it all happened at once.

I set up the TV and DVD player and Zoe happily christened it all by watching
some Play School DVDs, and then my Dad came back and picked us up.

So the apartment is now almost habitable. I just need my bed. That's scheduled
for Saturday. I'm planning on sleeping there on Saturday night.

In the furniture department, I'm still lacking a sofa, a dining table and
something to put the TV on. Leah has volunteered to help me shop tomorrow, but
I'm starting to think I should focus on resolving the lack of a car, then I
can do any further shopping myself.

Nick had set me up with a car wholesaler who was going to search for a used
Subaru Forester for me, but so far he hasn't turned anything up, so I'm
thinking I need to widen my net a little and use some other avenues as well.
I'd really wanted for the car finding to be outsourced as much as possible so
I could focus on other things, but it's not looking like that's going to be
the case, and I really need mobility.

I got a notification from Internode after I'd left today that the Internet
should now be working, so I need to configure the ADSL router when I next get
a chance and confirm that's the case, then I'm all sorted for being
technologically able to work from home.

Since there's a discussion of packaging software for Debian that uses Git
upstream on Planet Debian [right](http://danielpocock.com/autotools-project-
distribution-and-packaging-on-debian)
[now](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/upstream_git_repositories/), I wanted to
weigh in and advocate for my current workflow for this situation, which I'm
quite fond of. It's worth noting that I'm also upstream for quite a few of =
the
packages I maintain, all in Git, and I use (almost) exactly the same struct=
ure
for packaging my own software as for packaging anyone else's. So I have some
experience with both sides of this.

First off, I completely agree with Joey: if upstream is already using Git,
there's no reason not to base the Debian packaging on the upstream reposito=
ry,
and many, many reasons to do so. One of the biggest advantages is that when
repositories share a common basis and have been regularly merged, you can
easily cherry-pick commits, which is wonderful for security releases and
situations where you need a quick bug fix from an unreleased upstream branc=
h.
I make very heavy use of this when packaging OpenAFS.

I do, however, like to base the Debian packaging on the released tarball, if
for no other reason than that's the artifact that other people can more eas=
ily
confirm. Yes, you can do the same thing with a Git tag, but the tarball is
what upstream considers a release, so if one is available, I think it makes
the most sense to base the packaging on it. I do this even for my own
software.

Thankfully, it's not that difficult to do both. Sam Hartman was the one who
showed me this technique, and (after I used a manual script for some time f=
or
a couple of packages) Guido G=FCnther incorporated the support into git-imp=
ort-
orig. The key idea is to still import the tarball into the upstream branch,
but instead of making that import a simple commit, you make it a merge comm=
it
referencing the upstream release tag or commit from their Git repository.

This means that you still get the exact contents of the release tarball on =
the
upstream branch (and pristine-tar works as normal), but that branch is also
based on the full upstream line of development. Therefore, so is your
packaging branch (master or what have you) since you merge upstream into it.
You can then charry-pick and take advantage of all of the normal Git featur=
es
when following upstream development.

This is dead simple to do with git-import-orig. Just add the upstream
repository as a remote for your Git repository, make sure it's up to date w=
ith
`git fetch` and you have the upstream tags, and then pass the flag
`--upstream-vcs-tag <tag>` to git-import-orig whenever importing the upstre=
am
release tarball. git-import-orig will handle the construction of the merge
commit for you and everything will just work, exactly like it normally does
with git-buildpackage except with a more complete history.

This support was added in git-buildpackage 0.6.0~git20120324, so it's
available in unstable and testing.

(I was going to update my [notes on Debian packaging with
Git](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/notes/debian/git.html) to include this
information before posting this, but I see that it will require some
restructuring and quite a few changes to that document and I don't have time
tonight. Hopefully soon.)

Thanks to a generous donation by [Bytemark Hosting](http://bytemark.co.uk),
Debian started deploying machines for its core infrastructure services in a
new data center in York, UK.

This hardware and hosting donation will allow the [Debian Systems
Administration (DSA) team](http://dsa.debian.org) to distribute Debian's core
services across a greater number of geographically diverse locations, and
improve, in particular, the fault-tolerance and availability of end-user
facing services. Additionally, the storage component of this donation will
dramatically reduce the storage challenges that Debian currently faces.

The hardware provided by [Bytemark Hosting](http://bytemark.co.uk) consists of
a fully-populated [HP C7000 BladeSystem chassis](http://h18004.www1.hp.com/pro
ducts/blades/components/enclosures/c-class/c7000/) containing 16 server
blades:

  * 12 BL495cG5 blades with 2x Opteron 2347 and 64GB RAM each
  * 4 BL465cG7 blades with 2x Opteron 6100 series and 128GB RAM each

and several HP Modular Storage Arrays:

  * 3 MSA2012sa
  * 6 MSA2000 expansion shelves

with 108 drive bays in total, mostly 500GB SATA drives, some 2TB, some 600GB
15kRPM SAS, providing a total of 57 TB.

57 TB today could host roughly 80 times the current [Debian
archive](http://www.debian.org/mirror/size) or 3 times the [Debian
Snapshot](http://snapshot.debian.org/) archive. But remember both archives are
constantly growing!

Thank you, ftpmasters.

  
waagent ([Windows Azure Linux Agent](https://github.com/Windows-
Azure/WALinuxAgent)) hits Debian repository now... Yes, "Windows Azure" is

Subject: Daniel Pocock: Comparing packaging workflows in Debian and beyond
Date: Thu, 04 Apr 2013 14:00:51 -0000
Message-ID: <...@dev.null.invalid>
User-Agent: rss2email
X-RSS-Feed: debian/feed.rss
X-RSS-ID: http://danielpocock.com/42 at http://danielpocock.com
X-RSS-URL: http://danielpocock.com/comparing-packaging-workflows-in-debian-and-beyond

My blog post yesterday about [Debian's git packaging
workflows](http://danielpocock.com/autotools-project-distribution-and-
packaging-on-debian) was meant to help fill some gaps in the documentation of
this process, one of the most significant being the diagram.

I was surprised to find that some people felt my post argues that distribution
tarballs are a must-have or that separate repositories are the optimal
solution. In fact, my post was more a reflection of how things are being done,
and it is great to see contributions from
[Joey](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/upstream_git_repositories/),
[Russ](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/journal/2013-04/001.html) and
[Thomas](http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=94) proposing ways to integrate the
workflow in a single repository and also raising questions about the future of
tarballs. Some of the changes outlined by Russ only entered the tools after
many people were already using the workflow I have described.

Given the rise of collaboration, through [collab-
maint](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/collab-maint/) and packaging teams,
it is more important than ever that workflows and tools are easily understood
and documented. This lets new contributors (including people new to Debian)
jump in more quickly and with less risk of disruption. It would be great to
see some of these latest ideas covered more thoroughly with diagrams and I'm
happy for people to rip-off my [dia source
file](http://danielpocock.com/sites/danielpocock.com/files/release-packaging-
workflow.dia) for my own diagram and amend it as they please (under the
generous terms of the GPL v3)

### A look at other packaging systems

With the role of the tarball in people's sights, it's worth looking outside
Debian for a moment:

  * **Android** packaging is radically different. All packages have a single integer version number. The pretty version number displayed to the user is meaningless. Due to the continuously increasing integer version, and the way that database schemas are versioned, it is not really possible to even keep multiple release branches in a repository. For an example, see the version in the [Lumicall](http://www.lumicall.org) [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/opentelecoms-org/lumicall/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml) and the [database upgrade function](https://github.com/opentelecoms-org/lumicall/blob/master/src/org/lumicall/android/db/DatabaseHelper.java#L29). Google Play/Android Market makes no rules about how a project manages its code. [f-droid](http://f-droid.org), the open source market for apps, builds projects like Lumicall directly from git, it relies on them having an ant build file in the standard format generated by the SDK.
  * [**OpenCSW**](http://www.opencsw.org) does not keep upstream tarballs at all. They keep a single git repository for tracking all packages. Each package is built from a Makefile ([sample](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gar/browser/csw/mgar/pkg/ganglia/trunk/Makefile)), and their tool suite takes care of downloading the upstream sources (using a URL specified in the Makefile) and verifying against checksums tracked in the repository ([sample](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gar/browser/csw/mgar/pkg/ganglia/trunk/checksums)). The common style of the Makefiles makes it very easy for somebody familiar with the tools to work on just about any of the packages, and anybody who knows how to write a Makefile can start quickly.

Of course, these are just a few examples. These days, software is distributed
in many different ways, whether it is a runnable VM image or an embedded
device implanted during surgery.

Recently, I've been using `awk` in shell scripts more and more often.

When I saw [Thomas' Blog](http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=94) I reeled a bit
from of the `make`/`shell` quoted within. (Sorry Thomas! It's still a thought
provoking blog post):

    
    DEBVERS         ?= $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | sed -n -e 's/^Version: //p')
    VERSION         ?= $(shell echo '$(DEBVERS)' | sed -e 's/^[\[:digit:]]*://' -e 's/[-].*//')
    DEBFLAVOR       ?= $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | grep -E ^Distribution: | cut -d" " -f2)
    DEBPKGNAME      ?= $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | grep -E ^Source: | cut -d" " -f2)
    DEBIAN_BRANCH   ?= $(shell cat debian/gbp.conf | grep debian-branch | cut -d'=' -f2 | awk '{print $1}')
    GIT_TAG         ?= $(shell echo '$(VERSION)' | sed -e 's/~/_/')
    

I couldn't help but re-write it to be more efficient (and in the case of
`DEBIAN_BRANCH`, more correct):

    
    DEBVERS        := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | awk '/^Version:/ {print $$2}')
    VERSION        := $(shell echo '$(DEBVERS)' | sed -e 's/^[0-9]*://' -e 's/-.*//')
    DEBFLAVOR      := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | awk '/^Distribution:/ {print $$2}')
    DEBPKGNAME     := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | awk '/^Source:/ {print $$2}')
    DEBIAN_BRANCH  := $(shell awk 'BEGIN{FS="[= ]+"} /debian-branch/ {print $$2}' debian/gbp.conf)
    GIT_TAG        := $(subst ~,_,$(VERSION))

Given the recent discussions on [planet.debian.org](http://PLAnet.debian.org/)
I use the opportunity to describe how you can handle upstream history in a
[git-dpm](http://git-dpm.alioth.debian.org/) workflow.

One of the primary points of git-dpm is that you should be able to just check
out the Debian branch, get the `.orig.tar` file(s) (for example using
pristine-tar, by `git-dpm prepare` or by just downloading them) and then
calling `dpkg-buildpackage`.

Thus the contents of the Debian branch need to be clean from `dpkg-source`'s
point of view, that is do not contain any files the `.orig.tar` file(s)
contains not nor any modified files.

**The easy way**

The easiest way to get there is by importing the upstream tarball(s) as a git
commit, which one will usually do with `git-dpm import-new-upstream` as that
also does some of the bookkeeping.

This new git commit will have (by default) the previous upstream commit and
any parent you give with `-p` as parents. (i.e. with `-p` it will be a merge
commit) and its content will be the contents of the tarball (with multiple
`orig` files, it gets more complicated).

The idea is of course that you give the upstream tag/commit belonging to this
release tarball with `-p` so that it becomes part of your history and so git
blame can find those commits.

Thus you get a commit with the exact orig contents (so pristine-tar can more
easily create small deltas) and the history combined.

.

Sometimes there are files in the upstream tarball that you do not want to have
in your Debian branch (as you remove them in `debian/rules clean`), then when
using this method you will have those files in the upstream branch but you
delete them in the Debian branch. (This is why `git-dpm merge-patched` (the
operation to merge a new branch with upstream + patches with your previous
`debian/` directory) will look which files relative to the previous upstream
branch are deleted and delete them also in the newly merged branch by
default).

**The complicated way**

There is only a way without importing the `.orig.tar` file(s), though that is
a bit more complicated: The idea is that if your upstream's git repository
contains all the files needed for building your Debian package (for example if
you call `autoreconf` in your Debian package and clean all the generated files
in the clean target, or if upstream has a less sophisticated release process
and their .tar contains only stuff from the git repository), you can just use
the upstream git commit as base for your Debian branch.

Thus you can make upstream's commit/tag your upstream branch, by recording it
with `git-dpm new-upstream` together with the `.orig.tar` it belongs to (Be
careful, git-dpm does not check if that branch contains any files different
than your `.orig.tar` and could not decide if it misses any files you need to
build even if it tried to tell).

Once that is merged with the `debian/` directory to create the Debian branch,
you run `dpkg-buildpackage`, which will call `dpkg-source` which compares your
working directory with the contents of the `.orig.tar` with the patches
applied. As it will only see files not there but no files modified or added
(if everything was done correctly), one can work directly in the git checkout
without needing to import the `.orig.tar` files at all (altough the pristine-
tar deltas might get a bit bigger).

This was the first "normal" (i.e. not part of the Easter "long weekend") day.
As it happened, Easter Monday was surprisingly retail-friendly anyway.

My friend Kristy picked me up in the morning, and we dropped past the real
estate agent for my apartment to see if the tenants had happened to drop the
keys back yet (they hadn't) and then we went to Ikea and bought a bed for Zoe
a bunch of other random stuff. I also bought a bed frame and mattress while we
were at the neighbouring [Logan MegaCentre](http://public.mirvacretail.com.au/
mirvacs/search?site_name=Logan%20MegaCentre&site_id=16) (it's not a bad
shopping centre)

The bed frame is wooden and is taking 6-8 weeks to be made, so in the
meantime, because I bought a mattress from them, they're lending me a mattress
base. That's getting delivered on Saturday.

We then headed over to [Harvey Norman](http://www.harveynorman.com.au/) in
Fortitude Valley. We'd just got started there when the real estate agent
called to say the tenants had dropped the keys back, so we stopped and headed
back over to meet the property manager at the apartment and get the keys.

After that, we headed back to Harvey Norman and bought a fridge, TV, and a
bunch of small appliances, and then headed back to the apartment to do some
Ikea assembly. We'd just about finished putting Zoe's bed together when we
discovered we'd gotten the wrong width slats for her bed. It turns out there
are two widths of the "Sultan Lade" slats, and they're right next to each
other in the warehouse. We'd picked up from the correct location, but I think
the piles had become jumbled. Lesson learned: cross check the SKU as well as
the pickup location.

It was a long day, and I was enormously grateful to Kristy for driving me all
over the place, and generally helping me shop. I think it ended up being a 15
hour day for her.

The jet lag, the lack of sleep, and the general pace of the week has caught up
with me. I'm feeling decidedly run down today.

Leah volunteered to drive me around a bit today, and it was great to catch up
with her. I decided to check out a white 2004 Forester that I'd found on
[carsales.com.au](http://www.carsales.com.au/) the night before.

I took it for a test drive, and it seemed fine. I transferred my
[NRMA](http://www.nrma.com.au/) membership back to the
[RACQ](http://www.racq.com.au/) and upped it to something decent, and arranged
for them to do an inspection on Monday. Depending on when the inspection
report gets to me, I'll head back there with a bank cheque and I'll have a
car.

I had another half-hearted look at furniture after lunch (I really wasn't
feeling it) and then headed over to Woolloongabba to take a look at the
condition of Sarah's apartment.

The low light of the day was leaving my packet of car-related paperwork
(including my temporary driver's licence) on the roof of her car as we left
Woolloongabba. It should only be mildly inconvenient, but I was annoyed with
myself for being so dumb.

Tomorrow should be pretty quiet. I just have my bed getting delivered at
8:30am, then I'll stay in my apartment from then on. I think I'll just take it
easy.

Subject: Daniel Pocock: Quickstart: Integrating SIP support into any application with reSIProcate
Date: Fri, 05 Apr 2013 06:26:09 -0000
Message-ID: <...@dev.null.invalid>
User-Agent: rss2email
X-RSS-Feed: debian/feed.rss

Today's applications are more dynamic and interactive than ever before,
typically offering the user many ways to collaborate or get live data about
their community or environment as they need it.

Two open standards exist with a broad focus on real-time messaging and session
control, SIP and XMPP (Jabber). Both of them have been supercharged by the
development of technologies like WebRTC that makes every browser into a
communications endpoint. Here, we look at integrating SIP into any C++
application (either client or server). We use the industry standard SIP stack
[reSIProcate](http://www.resiprocate.org).

The quickest way to get started is with a Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora development
environment. reSIProcate is conveniently packaged on all those platforms (for
Fedora, it is not yet in yum and must be built from the tarball using
rpmbuild).

### Getting the environment set up

Once you have Debian or Ubuntu installed, just do:

    
    # apt-get build-dep resiprocate
    # apt-get install libresiprocate-1.8-dev
    

This will install all the necessary tools, libraries and header files. Headers
are under /usr/include/resip

### Writing some code

The object orientated nature of C++ is heavily leveraged by reSIProcate, and
this makes it easy to code. The stack is based on a callback paradigm: you
create some objects based on well-defined interfaces, give your objects to the
stack, and put the stack into a loop. The stack will call your object when
some event occurs (e.g. new incoming call, new text message)

The easiest way to see this in practice is to browse the test cases. The test
cases under the [resip/dum](https://svn.resiprocate.org/viewsvn/resiprocate/ma
in/resip/dum/test/)(mirrored on [github](https://github.com/resiprocate/resipr
ocate/tree/master/resip/dum/test)) section of the source tree provide good
high-level examples of the type of code an application writes when using
reSIProcate in an existing application.

### Sending a SIP text message

Based on the [basicMessage](https://svn.resiprocate.org/viewsvn/resiprocate/ma
in/resip/dum/test/basicMessage.cxx?revision=9367&view=markup) test case, I've
created a trivial piece of code below to send a text message over SIP. The
whole demo project is uploaded into
[github](https://github.com/resiprocate/sendsipmsg), see the
[README](https://github.com/resiprocate/sendsipmsg/blob/master/README) for
instructions on how to build and run.

Here, we have a quick look at the one object in the demo, it is notified on
the progress of the SIP text message:

    
    class ClientMessageHandler : public ClientPagerMessageHandler {
    public:
       ClientMessageHandler()
          : finished(false),
            successful(false)
       {
       };
    
       virtual void onSuccess(ClientPagerMessageHandle, const SipMessage& status)
       {
          InfoLog(<<"ClientMessageHandler::onSuccess\n");
          successful = true;
          finished = true;
       }
    
       virtual void onFailure(ClientPagerMessageHandle, const SipMessage& status, std::auto_ptr<contents> contents)
       {
          ErrLog(<<"ClientMessageHandler::onFailure\n");
          successful = false;
          finished = true;
       }
    
       bool isFinished() { return finished; };
       bool isSuccessful() { return successful; };
    
    private:
       bool finished;
       bool successful;
    };
    
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
       // boilerplate initialisation code...
    ...
       NameAddr naTo(to.c_str());
       ClientPagerMessageHandle cpmh = clientDum.makePagerMessage(naTo);
    
       Data messageBody("Hello world!");
       auto_ptr<contents> content(new PlainContents(messageBody));
       cpmh.get()->page(content);
    ...
    }
    </contents></contents>

### Going further with reSIProcate

  * Look at the [other test cases](https://svn.resiprocate.org/viewsvn/resiprocate/main/resip/dum/test/)
  * Look at some of the [contributed applications](https://svn.resiprocate.org/viewsvn/resiprocate/main/apps/), which include two click-to-call programs.
  * For browser integration, look at the [SIP over WebSockets](http://www.resiprocate.org/WebRTC_and_SIP_Over_WebSockets) support
  * Feel free to ask questions on the [mailing lists](http://list.resiprocate.org/mailman/listinfo)

Subject: Matthew Garrett: Leaked UEFI signing keys

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png) (See
[here](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/24463.html) for an update to this)

  
A hardware vendor [apparently had a copy of an AMI private key on a public FTP
site](http://adamcaudill.com/2013/04/04/security-done-wrong-leaky-ftp-
server/). This is concerning, but it's not immediately obvious how dangerous
this is for a few reasons. The first is that this is apparently the firmware
signing key, not any of the Secure Boot keys. That means it can't be used to
sign a UEFI executable or bootloader, so can't be used to sidestep Secure Boot
directly. The second is that it's AMI's key, not a board vendor - we don't
(yet) know if this key is used to sign any actual shipping firmware images, or
whether it's effectively a reference key. And, thirdly, the code apparently
dates from early 2012 - even if it was an actual signing key, it may have been
replaced before any firmware based on this code shipped.

  
But there's still the worst case scenario that this key _is_ used to sign most
(or all) AMI-based vendor firmware. Can this be used to subvert Secure Boot?
Plausibly. The attack would involve producing a new, signed firmware image
with Secure Boot either disabled or with an additional key installed, and then
to reflash that firmware. Firmware images are very board-specific, so unless
you're engaging in a very targeted attack you either need a large repository
of firmware for every board you want to attack, or you need to perform in-
place modification.

  
Taking a look at the firmware update tool used for AMI systems, the latter
might be possible. It seems that the AMI firmware driver allows you to dump
the existing ROM to a file. It'd then be a matter of pulling apart the
firmware image, modifying the key database, putting it back together, signing
it and flashing it. It looks like doing this does require that the user enter
the firmware password if one's set, so the simplest mitigation strategy would
be to do that.

  
So. If this key is used by most vendors shipping AMI-based firmware, and if
it's a current (rather than test) key, then it may well be possible for it to
be deployed in an automated malware attack that subverts the Secure Boot trust
model on systems running AMI-based firmware. The obvious lesson here is that
handing out your private keys to third parties that you don't trust is a
pretty bad idea, as is including them in source repositories.

  
(Wow, was [this](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01643.html)
really as long ago as 2004? How little things change)

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/philh.png)

Ben Goldacre ([Bad Science](http://badscience.net/)), is running a campaign
for all medical trials to be published.

It seems that [best current evidence](http://www.alltrials.net/wp-
content/uploads/2013/01/Missing-trials-briefing-note.pdf) indicates that about
half of the trials for treatments currently in use remain unpublished.

That's pretty astounding when you think about it. Given that many of the
trials that _are_ published only compare new treatments against placebo,
rather than against the best available existing treatment, and often barely
show them as being more effective than homeopathy`^W`sugar, one has to wonder
how dire were the results that are not being published.

If you prefer to have science done in the open, then I'd encourage you to
visit [www.alltrials.net](http://www.alltrials.net/) and sign the petition
and/or give [them](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/) a donation.

The fix is pretty straight-forward: Simply insist that clinical trials have to
register before they start in order to be considered valid, and that all
registered trials have to report their results. It need not be expensive to do
-- a git repo. shared across the industry, containing a file for each trial in
a standard format would do the trick probably. I imagine they'll come up with
a more expensive solution, but in comparison to the cost of running a decent
sized trial, it'll still be pocket change.

(A [note from the campaign](http://www.alltrials.net/blog/note-from-the-
campaign/), sent to existing petition signatories, is what prompted this blog

Over the week, around noon CEST, we had:

  * Monday: 44 total
  * Tuesday 43 total
  * Wednesday: 49 total
  * Thursday: 53 total

The [UDD bugs interface](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi) currently knows about
the following release critical bugs:

  * **In Total: [ 718](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=any&merged=ign&rc=1)**
    * **Affecting wheezy: [ 51](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy&merged=ign&rc=1)** That's the number we need to get down to zero before the release. They can be split in two big categories: 
      * **Affecting wheezy and unstable: [ 32](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_and_sid&merged=ign&rc=1)** Those need someone to find a fix, or to finish the work to upload a fix to unstable: 
        * **[ 9](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_and_sid&patch=only&merged=ign&done=ign&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&ctags=1&cdeferred=1) bugs are tagged 'patch'.** Please help by reviewing the patches, and (if you are a DD) by uploading them.
        * **[ 1](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_and_sid&merged=ign&done=only&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&ctags=1&cdeferred=1) bugs are marked as done, but still affect unstable.** This can happen due to missing builds on some architectures, for example. Help investigate!
        * **[ 22](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_and_sid&patch=ign&merged=ign&done=ign&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&ctags=1&ctags=1&cdeferred=1) bugs are neither tagged patch, nor marked done.** Help make a first step towards resolution!
      * **Affecting wheezy only: [ 19](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_not_sid&merged=ign&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&chints=1&ctags=1&cdeferred=1&crttags=1)** Those are already fixed in unstable, but the fix still needs to migrate to wheezy. You can help by submitting unblock requests for fixed packages, by investigating why packages do not migrate, or by reviewing submitted unblock requests. 
        * **[ 9](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_not_sid&merged=ign&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&chints=1&ctags=1&cdeferred=1&crttags=1&unblock-hint=only) bugs are in packages that are unblocked by the release team.**
        * **[ 10](http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=wheezy_not_sid&merged=ign&fnewerval=7&rc=1&sortby=id&sorto=asc&chints=1&ctags=1&cdeferred=1&crttags=1&unblock-hint=ign) bugs are in packages that are not unblocked.**

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png) According to the update
[here](http://adamcaudill.com/2013/04/04/security-done-wrong-leaky-ftp-
server/), the signing keys are supposed to be replaced by the hardware vendor.
If vendors do that, this ends up being uninteresting from a security
perspective - you could generate a signed image, but nothing would trust it.
It should be easy enough to verify, though. Just download a firmware image
from someone using AMI firmware, pull apart the capsule file, decompress
everything and check whether the leaked public key is present in the binaries.

  
The real risk here is that even if most vendors have replaced that key, some
may not have done. There's certainly an argument that shipping test keys at
all increases the probability that a vendor will accidentally end up using
those rather than generating their own, and it's difficult to rule out the
possibility that that's happened.

I was really not doing well by yesterday, I had developed quite the runny
nose. I've discovered that it's neigh on impossible (from my sample set of two
pharmacies) to get pseudoephedrine over the counter in this country. In the
US, you have to provide ID and they report all purchases to the government and
if you start buying too much, they come and kick down the door of your meth
lab. Here, you seem to need a prescription. One pharmacy told me that 1 in 10
pharmacies will sell it over the counter. I ended up with the Australian
equivalent of [Afrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrin_(nasal_spray)), which
I don't particularly like, but it at least dried up my nose. Discussions on
Facebook suggest that I may have been dealing with second-rate pharmacies, and
the "big ones" would be more useful. I was also advised to try begging and
pleading for Claritin-D. The damn meth labs have ruined it for everybody. It's
too bad they can't come up with an additive that is safe to ingest, but would
fuck up the meth cooking process.

Not content with only two marathon shopping days, Kristy came back for a third
day of driving me all around town, as my quest for a sofa bed and a dining
table continued.

It turns out that one does not simply walk into a furniture store and walk out
with a sofa bed (or a dining table, for that matter). These things all seem to
be on boats from China, or at best interstate warehouses, and most places can
sell you something they know is in transit at best, but they're loathe to sell
floor stock (for obvious reasons), and they seem to not have anything in a
Brisbane warehouse (plenty of stuff was in Sydney or Melbourne and they'd ship
it up). [Plush](http://www.plush.com.au/)had a chaise sofa bed that had a nice
sprung mattress, and was due in late this month or early next, and they would
lend me something in the meantime, so they got my business. I look forward to
having something to sit on.

We then had an epic time at Bunnings getting all sorts of random household
stuff, with the obligatory sausage sizzle before and after. Oh, how I have
missed proper sausages! It turns out I'm looking for something that doesn't
seem to exist over here, Rubbermaid don't seem to make the plastic "shed"
cupboards in Australia, so I'll have to look elsewhere ([Clark
Rubber](http://www.clarkrubber.com.au/utility-rattan-cabinet.html) seems to
make something approximately like what I'm looking for).

Then I picked up some towels from Westfield Chermside and resumed the search
for a dining table. I was really liking the idea of at least one bench seat,
and we finally found a matching table, a bench seat, some shelving and a
coffee table that would work as an entertainment unit, at [OZ Design
Furniture](http://www.ozdesignfurniture.com.au/). They had a 20% off sale that
made it all fairly reasonable. The entertainment unit was available
immediately, and the rest of the stuff should be delivered in a couple of
weeks. That just leaves finding some dining chairs that will go with it.

OZ Design Furniture had the most unusual delivery charging system. They charge
by the flight of stairs. Living on the 2nd floor does have its disadvantages.
At least I won't be moving out of here any time soon.

By the end of the day, I was totally done, but very happy to have finally
sorted out the elusive remaining bits of furniture. I had my first night
sleeping in my new home.

Subject: Steve Kemp: So I have a wheezy desktop

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/skx.png)

I look after a bunch of servers, working for
[Bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/) that is not a surprise, but I only
touch a very small number of desktop systems.

`precious` - My desktop

    

This is the machine upon which I develop, check my personal mail, play my
music & etc.

`steve` - My work machine

    

To keep the [working from
home](http://blog.steve.org.uk/on_working_from_home.html) separation going I
have a machine I only use for work purposes.

`travel`/`travel2` - EEPC box

    

I have two EEPC machines, a personal 701 and a work-provided 901.

Honestly these rarely get used. One is for when I'm on holiday or traveling,
the second for when I'm on-call.

Yesterday I got round to upgrading both the toy EEPC machines to wheezy. The
good news? Both of them upgraded/reinstalled easily. Hardware was all
detected, sleeping, hibernation, wifi, etc all "just worked".

Unfortunately I am now running GNOME 3.x and the experience is unpleasant.
This is a shame, because I've enjoyed GNOME 2.x & bluetile for the past few
years.

The only other concern is that [pwsafe](http://packages.debian.org/pwsafe)
appears to be scheduled for removal from Debian GNU/Linux - the list of open
bugs shows some cause, but there are bugs there that are trivial to fix.

For the moment I've rebuilt the package and if I cannot find a suitable
alternative - available for squeeze and wheezy - then I will host the package
on my [package repository](http://packages.steve.org.uk/).

In conclusion: Debian, you did good. GNOME, I've loved and appreciated you for
years, but you might not be the desktop I want these days. It's not you, it's
me.

With [DebConf13](http://debconf13.debconf.org) registrations opening very
soon, it's about time to share some more about Swiss travel.

For all those who enjoyed the [Glacier Express](http://danielpocock.com
/switzerland-glacier-express) video, now there is another. This is the [Rigi
Bahn](http://www.rigi.ch) rack railway which goes from
[Vitznau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitznau) up to the [top of Mount
Rigi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigi) (often just referred to as Rigi). At
the top, it meets another train which goes to the junction of main railway
lines at [Arth-Goldau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arth-Goldau), and a cable
car to [Weggis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weggis)

The video starts at the station in Vitznau (beside the ferry terminal) and
rises up rapidly in a breathtaking ride to the snowy peak at approximately
2,000 meters. There are spectacular views of mountains to the south across the
lake, and look out for the wild animals on the way. You need at least a 2Mbit
connection to stream this video:

### Swiss railway tickets

When looking at the price of rail passes, keep in mind the maximum price paid
by a Swiss resident is never more than 8 CHF per day, because that is the cost
of the unlimited annual ticket that many people have. People who don't have
the unlimited pass have what is called a `half price card' which costs 150 CHF
per year and allows them to buy any ticket at half the advertised price. This
means that only the tourists pay the full advertised price, which is usually
quite exorbitant. It is an extremely effective system of discrimination. A
touist pays 8 CHF just for a 1 day pass for the center of a city like Zurich.

Switzerland does offer some short term unlimited passes that provide some
discounts to visitors, it is necessary to think carefully about how many days
you want to use to get the optimal package:

  * [Swiss Travel System](http://www.swisstravelsystem.com) web site offers the passes for all of Switzerland. Visitors can buy a multi-day unlimited pass, and also get several days of half-price travel as well. For 5 days unlimited travel within 1 month, the cost is 364 CHF, includes half price travel for all other days in the month. Shorter and longer periods available.
  * The [Tell Pass](http://www.tellpass.ch/), named after [William Tell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tell) is significantly cheaper, offering unlimited travel just within the central mountain area. The Tell Pass includes use of the Rigi Bahn train shown in this blog, and is valid for travel to Andrematt, where you have to buy an extra ticket to ride on the [Glacier Express](http://danielpocock.com/switzerland-glacier-express) train from the other blog. That is not so bad though, because you can buy a one-way ticket from Andermatt up to Natschen and then walk back down. The region covered by the Tell Pass is really quite big, centered around [Luzern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzern), it goes all the way west to [Interlaken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaken) and south-east to [Andermatt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andermatt) in the high mountains. Tell Pass costs 246 CHF for 15 days half-price travel including 5 days unlimited travel. Shorter periods available too.
  * [More regional passes](http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/home/tickets-en/ticketfinder-en/regional-passes.html) like the Tell Pass are available for people who want to spend less money by just visiting one area of Switzerland.
  * [The SBB.ch web site](http://www.sbb.ch/en) has all the timetables for the trains, ferries, Postbuses and other services.

I'd decided ahead of time that I wanted to use
[Internode](http://internode.on.net/) as my ISP, and had ordered a Naked DSL
service from them and also decided to bundle my mobile phone with them as
well. For reasons that only made sense to me 7 years ago, I've been paying
Telstra to keep my mobile number going, but I've long since lost the SIM. My
current phone has a micro-SIM anyway, so I needed a replacement SIM.

My grand plan had been to order the SIM, order the number port from Telstra to
Internode, and then, well, profit from the moment I stuck the SIM in my phone.
Unfortunately the port didn't go through as planned, and I was left
incommunicado for the better part of two and a half days. I felt like I had my
hands tied behind my back not having a mobile data service. It was also mildly
annoying not being able to call people or be contactable, given the amount of
running around I was doing. But it got resolved and is fast becoming a distant
memory.

The DSL service required a Telstra technician to come out (I'm not actually
sure why) and that was scheduled for Thursday. I happened to catch him while
he was at my building's MDF, and had a bit of a chat with him. He was a
Scotsman, and I didn't get all the details, but he was going on about how he
was only there to operate on the exchange side of the MDF, and I'd have to get
someone else to jumper it up to my apartment.

This wasn't what I expected from an installation service, but sure enough when
I finally got around to plugging the ADSL modem in on Saturday morning, there
was no line sync to be had. A call to Internode confirmed that he'd only
jumpered it up to exchange side of the MDF.

What was even more annoying was I'm pretty sure I saw him yanking out jumper
wires from the MDF when he was working on it. Jumper wires that connected the
exchange side of the MDF to my apartment.

I was not thrilled with the idea of waiting (and paying) for a cabling
contractor to come out and hook up a couple of bits of jumper wire, so I put
out a call on Facebook for a Krone tool and a tone generator, and Brent was
able to come through for me. He dropped the gear around while I was out
shopping with Kristy, and when we got back, I located the pair for my unit,
and rejumpered the existing jumper wire that I'm pretty sure the Telstra
technician had disconnected. Lo and behold, my ADSL started working. I felt
pretty proud of myself. It's fun operating at Layer 1 every now and then.

The [FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN 7270](http://fritzbox.com.au/product-fritz-
wlan7270.html) is quite the beast of a box. Not only is it an ADSL modem, it's
a wireless router, DECT base station, VoIP thingy and an answering machine!
I've managed to connect my Engin account up to it, so once I get a DECT
handset, I'll be able to make VoIP calls through it. I don't need to run
Asterisk any more.

Subject: Olivier Berger: Migrating picture tags from KPhotoAlbum to digiKam (or others) through IPTC

![](http://planet.debian.org/heads/obergix.png)

I've occasionally used KPhotoAlbum for a few years and eventually added many
tags to the pictures.

But I've decided I wanted to try other tools, and digiKam seems to be the best
option from the many reviews I've read.

Still, there's apparently no automatic feature to import into digiKam the tags
set in KPhotoAlbum.

Fortunately, some smart people have implemented Perl tools allowing to
overcome this issue.

The process involves modifying the pictures to save the tags inside the files,
using the IPTC standard. Then, digiKam will be able to load the tags from the
modified files.

Here's a copy of the (translated) `[kphotoalbum2iptc.pl](http://www.olivierber
ger.com/weblog/public/kphotoalbum2iptc_pl.txt)` script (the original as in
french) I copied from [this blog post](http://blog.jesuislibre.org/2009/4/20
/export-vos-donnees-de-kphotoalbum-vers-iptc/) (in french too).

I've been able to generate .deb packages for the required 2 perl libs
dependencies using the method described in the referenced post , with : `dh-
make-perl --build --cpan Image::Kimdaba` and `dh-make-perl --build --cpan
Image::IPTCInfo`

  
Thanks to Pierre Doucet and Bruno Adele for sharing this. Hope this helps.

We are pleased to announce the 15th annual Debian Conference (DebConf14) is to
be held in Portland, Oregon, USA in August 2014, with specific dates yet to be
announced.

Portland is an open source hotspot in the Pacific Northwest of the US. It is a
technologically savvy community, home to Intel and the adopted home of Linus
Torvalds. The city plays host to many Free Software conferences including
[OSCON](http://www.oscon.com), and is where [Linux
Plumbers](http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org) originated.

The local team has been involved in mulitple DebConfs in the past, and is
excited to bring their experience and ideas to fruition in a city well-
positioned to host such a prestigious event.

Subject: Bits from Debian: Debian joins Free & Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women
Date: Mon, 08 Apr 2013 06:01:00 -0000
Message-ID: <...@dev.null.invalid>
User-Agent: rss2email

The GNOME Foundation started the [Free & Open Source Software Outreach Program
for Women, OPW](http://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen), in 2010. In
the January-April 2013 round, many other FOSS organizations joined the
program. We are happy to announce that Debian will also join in the next round
from June-September and we'll offer one internship.

You can find more details about Debian's participation in the program at
[Debian OPW page](http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen).

## Call for mentors and projects

OPW allows applicants to work on any kind of project, including coding,
design, marketing, web development... The [Debian Google Summer of Code
projects](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2013/Projects) will be offered
also as possible projects for OPW, but GSoC only allows coding projects. If
you have any idea of a non-coding project and you want to mentor it, please
contact us in the [soc-coordination mailing
list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/soc-coordination) adding
[OPW] in subject.

OPW works in the same way as GSoC except Google doesn't play a part here. The
same advice that is provided for GSoC mentors works for OPW mentors.

## Call for participants

The main goal of this program is to increase the number of women in FOSS, so
all women who are not yet a Debian Developer or a Debian Maintainer are
encouraged to apply. There are no age restrictions and applicants don't need
to be a student.

If you want to apply, you must follow three steps:

  1. Choose a project [from this list](http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen). There are two lists, one for GSoC and another with non-coding tasks that can be only offered by the OPW. Those lists may change and add or remove more projects in the next few weeks.

  2. Make a small contribution to Debian. Projects will add a task the applicant must complete as part of the pre-selection process. If no task is provided, you are welcome to ask the mentors of the project. You can also make a different extra task of the one listed to show your skills and interest.

  3. Create a page in the Debian wiki with your application. You can do so under pseudonym, but in that case, please give us information about yourself privately by email to the coordinators listed in the [Debian OPW page](http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen)!

Even though I haven't had much time to dedicate to
[http.debian.net](http://http.debian.net) lately, it has been up and running,
or should I say serving?

  
Part of its job is to detect mirrors that have temporary issues or are
entirely gone, down, unavailable. It does so, and many other things, by
monitoring the so-called "trace files". A very important one being the
"_master_" (or "origin") trace file.

  
With the recent [integration of backports into the main
archive](http://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130320), the master trace file of
the backports mirrors also changed. Long story short, this change caused
backports mirrors to no longer be considered by the mirror redirector as
candidates. As long as they were up to date.

  
After the usual mirror synchronisation delay, more and more mirrors were
disabled and subsets of "up to date" candidates re-calculated. This reached a
critical point when only one mirror was left in the database. The mirror had
not been synchronised for a couple of weeks.

  
This mirror is located in Costa Rica, and as the only candidate left in the
database it was the only one used to serve requests for the backports archive.
No matter where the client was located in the world.

  
The issue was later noticed and the necessary updates to the mirrors master
list made. Mirrors started to be re-considered as they were re-checked (with
some delay due to the [rate limiter](http://rgeissert.blogspot.com/2012/12
/nicer-but-stricter.html)) and the subsets re-calculated. In a few hours
everything was back to normality.

  
Correctness and fault-tolerance don't always get together very well...

I've had quite a few queries about the project ideas for Google Summer of Code
on the [Lumicall](http://www.lumicall.org/google-summer-of-code) and
[Debian](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2013/Projects) project pages and
I'm publishing some notes here to help people get the best chance of
participating, while also helping people's expectations.

Firstly, _Google is responsible for administering the program and payments,
they have the last word on which projects and students participate_ and free
software developers like myself have no direct control over this. In other
words, while I would encourage students to make contributions to free software
projects to familiarize themselves with the way we work, I can not promise
that this will automatically lead to selection. If you are a student, do go
ahead and feel free to comment on or make contributions to projects, this
helps mentors to see your capabilities very quickly, but don't do any more
than you would have done if the GSoC program didn't exist. In any case,
building up a portfolio of work that is [visible on sites like
github](https://github.com/dpocock/) does help your employment prospects in
the long run. If a development manager is looking at 100 CVs for a job
vacancy, and one of them has a strong portfolio on github or Debian, there is
a good chance that one person will get an interview - although it doesn't
guarantee they get the job.

### Where to start?

If you are a student and you are already heavily involved in some free
software project then you probably don't need to read the rest of this. The
reality is that GSoC is meant to help bring more people into the free software
community and this means we need to help people get their foot in the door.
That is what I am addressing here, with examples from my own possible
projects.

When I went through university in the 90s, there was a very strong UNIX
culture in our computer science department and the wider engineering faculty.
There were also winds of change, for example, a new dean who wanted to change
everything to Windows and a central IT management agenda to abolish campus
computers and force students to carry and maintain their own laptops. Around
the world, every campus has a different approach. I was fortunate to have UNIX
topics like the [vi text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi), [shell
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) and even
[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) taught as a formal part of the
course, students coming after me may have missed those opportunities. I
understand that some students have not encountered these concepts at all
today. That said, most mentors have a fairly wide tolerance for these things:
it is not expected that students know these things, rather, it is an
opportunity for you to start learning them whether it is part of your course
or not.

The key concept here is to be a self-starter: it is not what you know, but
your enthusiasm to go and try the things you don't know. That is the very
thing you can start doing now, even before the program commences. Doing this
will definitely help you identity the areas of free software and Debian that
you are most likely to get excited about, and that will lead to a successful
project.

### Some general ideas to get started

  * If your campus hasn't taught UNIX in a formal sense, please familiarise yourself with the basics. While some companies do have more jobs working with other platforms, and some campuses have sadly tried to adapt their courses to prepare students for that limited subset of companies, _all the best jobs I've had involve UNIX or Linux_. I've never worked for a hedge fund that didn't use Linux. [Hollywood](http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2013/03/27/dreamworks-animation-the-croods-tops-9100-linux-render-years/) uses Linux, [NASA does too](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-space-age), but learning Linux is not rocket science. Basic things to understand include [the vi text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi), [shell scripts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) and using a command line tool for version control, [preferably git](http://git-scm.com/). As you will be the system administrator of your own desktop or laptop, it's essential to understand some basic concepts like [volume management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29) too.
  * If you need to run some Windows software (some courses do require that), use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or a similar solution to run both Windows and Linux on your computer or laptop. The VirtualBox documentation is very good and will help you start quickly. My own laptop runs Debian 7 (wheezy) as the main operating system, and I have Windows and Solaris in VirtualBox for some business applications.
  * My own course included a project that involved downloading the open source [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) program, writing a patch and testing it. If you've never done something like that, please try. Instead of downloading a project tarball, these days you will typically clone the project's git repository. Even if you only make some trivial change that you will never share, it is good to prove that you can compile and successfully execute something like this.

### Some specific ideas for my own projects

  * For Lumicall or Android development, just work your way through the [build instructions](http://www.lumicall.org/source-code-and-build-instructions) that are published for all contributors. Trying the [f-droid build instructions](http://f-droid.org/manual/fdroid.html#Setup) is also a good way to start.
  * For any of the Debian projects, please make sure you have installed Debian 7 (wheezy) on a desktop, laptop or virtual machine. Just follow the [installation guide](http://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/amd64/)
  * Once you have installed Debian, try installing whichever one of my packages interests you. Try to configure and use it. Prove that the package works in a normal installation. Look at the log files. Run the test cases.
  * Next, try obtaining the source code and building the package. Debian makes it very easy. Here is an example for [reSIProcate](http://packages.debian.org/source/wheezy/resiprocate), the same works for any other package. As root: 
    
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get build-dep resiprocate
    

will obtain all the necessary build tools. Then, as a normal user:

    
    $ mkdir ~/src/resiprocate
    $ cd ~/src/resiprocate
    $ apt-get source resiprocate
    $ cd resiprocate
    $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -j12
    

In a few minutes, you should find the packages (*.deb files) are created.

  * Now, you could try making some small change to the package and compiling it again. Verify that your change works.

If you've successfully got to this point, then there is every chance you will
be able to successfully complete a GSoC project. If you struggled along the
way, that is OK too, the important thing to do is to engage with the community
and learn how to ask for help. The [Debian GSoC wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/S
ummerOfCode2013/#Ideas_list_.2F_Participating_.2F_Applying) provides some
excellent ideas about engaging with the project using IRC chat and mailing
lists. It is also very worthwhile trying to find a [local
group](http://wiki.debian.org/LocalGroups) or a free software event that
[Debian is attending](http://www.debian.org/events/) near you and spending a
few hours with people who can look at any problems you have and give you quick
solutions.

As you may have guessed, this is yet another short story by Scalzi that was
rolled into the Subterranean Scalzi Super Bundle. This one is a bit longer
than the ones I've previously reviewed, and is also illustrationed. Unlike
some of the others, it's not available on-line for free... as a written work
at least. There's an [abridged audio version](http://subterraneanpress.com/mag
azine/winter_2010/audio_judge_sn_goes_golfing_by_john_scalzi) available for
free from Subterranean Press's web site, though. Like the other stories I've
reviewed so far, it's humor, but I think it's a bit more successful and
substantial than the previous short stories.

Judge Bufan Nigun Sn is an extremely foul-tempered alien judge who loves to
golf, despite being terrible at it. He's a sort of circuit court judge for a
larger galactic civilization, of which Earth is now part. (There's a
smattering of background world-building, but it's not the core of the story.)
Golf is his passion, in several senses of the word: his habit of getting into
nasty fights with his fellow players and otherwise making public and
occasionally injurious scenes has gotten him banned from every course in the
Washington DC area, both public and private. Except, that is, for Dulles
Woods, a dire, badly-maintained course designed via nepotism and theft whose
business model is primarily based on letting the people banned from every
other course golf there. And charging them extra to let caddies accompany
them.

The plot of this story is about a particular game of golf, dramatically
foreshadowed by the opening sentence. But the story is really about Judge Sn's
relationship to golfing and to the notorious Dulles Woods. It's one of the
better jobs I've seen of writing a thoroughly unlikable person into a
gloriously foul-tempered charm. It's also a story about a golf course and
golfer who thoroughly deserve each other, and about how it feels to suddenly
have something go right after grinding out hours and hours of work on a hobby
that is supposed to be fun but manages to fall into some horribly compelling
middle ground between enjoyment and rage-inducing frustration.

Speaking as someone who is known to grind out video game completions while
swearing at the television, I can sympathize.

I got thoroughly hooked by Scalzi's descriptions of Judge Sn's mental state
and enjoyed this story far more than I expected to. Sadly, when the plot does
finally arrive, I thought it was a letdown. Scalzi throws in a highly
improbable coincidence to create action, and while that's a legitimate plot
technique (particularly in humor), it works best when the author goes back
afterwards and fills in the back story of the coincidence. Pratchett does this
extremely well. Scalzi, alas, doesn't really bother, and while suspension of
disbelief isn't as relevant for this sort of story, I thought it was a missed
opportunity. The ending seemed to be missing some sort of punch or background
twist.

That said, I really liked the character study and I think the story is well
worth the 99 cents it's still selling for on the Kindle (and quite possibly
other platforms; I haven't checked). If buying short stories on the Kindle is
something you want to do, I recommend this one to your attention.

I bought a ScanJet N6350 a few years back, in the belief that it would work.
After all, you write free Linux drivers for all your printers, and when those
printers are multifunctional printers with scanners, you do make sure the
scanner bits of those printers work too. So it shouldn't be too hard to write
a Linux driver for that scanner too, right?

Apparently it is. For some reason that I can't imagine, you decided that my
money is worth more than my stress levels.

  * The HP ScanJet N6350 is a combination USB/network scanner. That's great; I don't need it to be right next to my laptop all the time. Having the ability to get it sent to me by email (as your product page claims it can do) reduces my workload. Unfortunately, what you didn't mention on the product page is that the scanner is pretty dumb; it does network, yes, but the only way in which it can send emails is by using some application running on a system on the other end of the network connection. That's pretty silly. It wouldn't be so bad, however, except...
  * ... the system on the other end of the network connection has to be running Windows. That's right, you _didn't_ write a Linux driver for some reason. You also _didn't_ publish the network protocol, and even the USB connection seems undocumented. So I can't use Linux to scan my documents. It wouldn't be so bad, however, since I already have a Windows XP virtual machine lying around somewhere, mainly because there's this satellite navigation system builtin to my car that also requires it; I just installed your scanners oftware on that machine, and I can scan. Except...
  * ... whenever an error occurs in the scanning process, _the UI locks up completely_. I can't retry the last page that I was trying to scan, and often I can't even _save_ the document anymore, either; I have to rescan the whole document. That wouldn't be so bad, except...
  * ... the ADF is total crap. If I put more than a few pages on the feeder, and they've got some horizontal folds in them (as is likely with snail mail that came out of an envelope), I'm very likely to end up with a paper jam, or with multiple pages sucked into the feeder at once, causing an error and a loss of my scanned document. That wouldn't be so bad, except...
  * ... the process for finishing one scan and starting the next involves stopping and starting your whole scanning software, which takes a rather long time. As such, I'd prefer to just scan a whole stack of incoming snail mail in one go, and then use [pdfsam](http://www.pdfsam.org/) to split up the PDF file. But then I have to babysit the scanning process so that I don't get any errors; but I fail at that about as often as I succeed, meaning, it usually takes a _long_ time to get through the stack.

Dear HP, you suck. I fail to understand how the basic loss of functionality
after a failed scan managed to get through your testing. I fail to understand
why you think Linux users should be able to print, but not scan. And I
_especially_ fail to understand why I should waste my time with such an
expensive device that can't even perform its basic functionality with more
than 10% success rate.
