Subject: Detect 2.x database

As noted in #752522, it is quite confusing to have "r2e list" display nothing
after an upgrade from 2.x to 3.x. Even though it is in NEWS.Debian, not all
users read it so it is better to display a message if a 2.x database exists and
no feeds are found.

This is specific to the wheezy -> jessie upgrade, so will probably be dropped
after jessie is released.
