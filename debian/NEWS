rss2email (1:3.5-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  rss2email 3.x introduces a new, incompatible format for configuration and
  feed data. Please review the r2e(1) manpage for details on the new
  configuration format.

  You can migrate (parts of) your data, using the provided r2e-migrate
  executable: it will set up your default email address and feed list, but not
  the already-seen database.
